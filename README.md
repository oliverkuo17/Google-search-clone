# Google-search-clone

This project is inspired by Harvard CS50's homepage project

The goal is to create a homepage that matches Googleâ€™s own aesthetics while google search, google image search, google advanced search still functional.

The web page is published on: https://oliverkuo17.github.io/Google-search-clone/index.html

Users will have the access to switch to image search or advanced search by the link on the top-right.
